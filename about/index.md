Hello there! I'm a **Computer Science** student and developer. I study in <a href="https://www.ufpe.br/english" target="_blank">Federal University of Pernambuco</a>, in Brazil. 

This blog is meant to share some of the knowlegde I may gain down the road, most probably related to **Linux**, **C++**, **Qt**, **shell script**, **git** and **Firefox OS**. Maybe I'll help someone **:)**

As an open-source developer and evangelist, I'm a contributor of [LXQt](http://lxqt.org), [QTerminal](https://github.com/qterminal) and [QtDesktop](https://github.com/QtDesktop).


**May the force be with you!**
